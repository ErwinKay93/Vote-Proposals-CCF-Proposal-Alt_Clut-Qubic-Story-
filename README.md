## Intro

I’m not a big fan of having AI hijack my output, so I wrote this myself — like I do with all my work…

I love $Qubic. It's the strongest crypto project I’ve ever seen in my 7 years in crypto. That’s why I’ve dedicated over 1,440+ hours to Sergey’s vision and the computer's power.

- I've written 40+ X posts exclusively about Qubic — generating **250,000+ views**.
- My work has **indirectly brought in hundreds of thousands to potentially millions** in investment and visibility to Qubic.
- This proposal outlines a **33-video series** — of which **12 are already completed**.

I aim to **bridge the gap between education, entertainment, and virality** — creating layered, sometimes delusional (😉) content with the power to break out of the crypto bubble and reach new investors.

As Qubic's market cap rises, **so will my content’s reach**, which already totals **25,000+ views** and growing rapidly. I’m obsessed, I’m strategic, and I’m here to help **40%+ of the world’s population** — one video at a time.
